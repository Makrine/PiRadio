# PiRadio

PiRadio is a lightweight Internet radio for Raspberry Pi that runs with a simple on-screen interface. It’s operated using a rotary encoder to navigate menus and control playback on a connected display.

PiRadio uses the MQTT protocol to broadcast what is currently playing, allowing external clients (such as a web interface) to stay in sync. It can also receive playback and selection commands via MQTT, enabling remote control from a web server or other connected services.
